# ðŸ”¥ sel-simple-DOM-selector


## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction:

I was annoyed by spamming document.querySelector(...) and document.querySelectorAll(...) so after years I decided to write a small library to do this for me 

## ðŸ”§ Usage:

#### 1. Add CDN:

Copy the following code into your HTML: 

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/MarcoSteinke/sel-simple-DOM-selector@0f1d5de5ba43d9f175c777653191b4531232b86e/sel.js"></script>
```


#### 2. Use the following functions:

```javascript
// Select an element from DOM
const sl = (selector, root = document) => root.querySelector(selector);

// Select all elements with specific selector from DOM
const sla = (selector, root = document) => root.querySelectorAll(selector);

// Select n-th element with specific selector from DOM
const sln = (selector, n, root = document) => sla(selector)[n];

// Select first element with specific selector from DOM
const slf = (selector, root = document) => sla(selector, root)[0];

// Select last element with specific selector from DOM
const sll = (selector, root = document) => sla(selector, root)[sla(selector, root).length - 1];
```
