# ðŸ”¥ sel-simple-DOM-selector


## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction:

I was annoyed by spamming document.querySelector(...) and document.querySelectorAll(...) so after years I decided to write a small library to do this for me .

The changes in this repository where partially discussed on reddit before :)

## ðŸ”§ Usage:

#### 1. Add CDN:

Copy the following code into your HTML: 

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/MarcoSteinke/sel-simple-DOM-selector@0a54deba0951d98d617d1f0d36e7172c1cd5de6c/sel.js"></script>
```


#### 2. Use the following functions:

* selector always means the argument which would be passed into 

```javascript
root.queryselector(selector)
```

For example "div", ".btn".

* root tells the functions in which container the elements should be selected! 

IMPORTANT: root is required to be a DOMElement, e.g.

```javascript
sl("div", sl("#carousel"))

// and not
sla("div", "#carousel"));
```

IMPORTANT: This may be simplified in the future!

* sl:(selector, root = document) Select an element from DOM
* sla:(selector, root = document) Select all elements with specific selector from DOM
* sln:(selector, n, root = document) Select n-th element with specific selector from DOM
* slf:(selector, root = document) Select first element with specific selector from DOM
* sll:(selector, root = document) Select last element with specific selector from DOM

#### 3. Example:

```javascript
const nav = sl("nav");

// Select all divs in nav:

// (1) Nav already stored in a variable
const divsInNav = sla("div", nav);

// (2) Select all divs in nav without storing in a variable:
const divsInNav = sla("div", sl("nav"));
```
