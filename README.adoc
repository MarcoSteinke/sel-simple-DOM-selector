# 🔥 sel-simple-DOM-selector


## 👋 Introduction:

I was annoyed by spamming document.querySelector(...) and document.querySelectorAll(...) so after years I decided to write a small library to do this for me 

## 🔧 Usage:

#### 1. Add CDN:

Copy the following code into your HTML: 

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/MarcoSteinke/sel-simple-DOM-selector@43bea9f570ae60c44400bbf8ba64454b0f0d7c3e/sel.js"></script>
```


#### 2. Use the following functions:

```javascript
// Select an element from DOM
const sel = (selector) => document.querySelector(selector);

// Select all elements with specific selector from DOM
const selA = (selector) => document.querySelectorAll(selector);

// Select n-th element with specific selector from DOM
const selN = (selector, n) => document.querySelectorAll(selector)[n];

// Select first element with specific selector from DOM
const selF = (selector) => document.querySelectorAll(selector)[0];

// Select last element with specific selector from DOM
const selL = (selector) => document.querySelectorAll(selector)[document.querySelectorAll(selector).length - 1];
```
